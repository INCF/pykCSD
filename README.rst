pykCSD
------

Kernel Current Source Density is a recently developed method for estimating the density of trans-membrane current sources, which can be used for a detailed study of neuronal synaptic dynamics.

It can estimate current source density from potentials measured with irregularly placed linear, planar and spatial electrodes.
